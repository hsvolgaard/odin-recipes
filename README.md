So I don't currently know much about this project but it seems I'll be tackling how to make a brutalist web design (is the excuse to say its gonna look good).

I imagine this will entail some paragraphs (p), images (img src/alt), and text types. (strong / em)

most likely a good couple links and different pages to the website.

let's give this a proper shot and not try to "cheat" too much. We can do this.
